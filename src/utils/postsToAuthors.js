/**
 * Utility :: Takes a list of posts and returns a list of
 * unique authors with a nested list of posts they've written.
 *
 * @PERFORMANCE :: Technically this is an O(nÂ²) algorithm,
 * but acceptable because there's usually one and maximally
 * two authors per posts, effectively rendering it 2O(n).
 * A pure functional approach was also considered but led
 * to nearly double the amount of iterations over the posts array.
